This completely resolves spline twisting issues by switching to up vector interpolation instead of using the broken quaternion interpolation. Remaining rotation data simply requires a tangent to get the forward vector to complete the rotation.

ISSUES:
- The Unreal Editor integration is not complete, and results in crashes.
- Quaternion spline is not removed, only up vector spline was added. Quaternion spline needs to be removed for a clean implementation, relying only on constructing a quaternion with the up vector and forward vector instead.
- Alternative implementation is to fix quaternion spline interpolation.

Based on UE 5.4, completely untested elsewhere.
